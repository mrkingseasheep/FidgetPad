# FidgetPad V2.1

![Render 1](img/final1.png)

Keyboards are flat. Flat is boring. Why not add some turny things?
This is a 3x3 macropad with 2 rotary encoders that originally had an OLED screen before I realized that I could trade it in for a 3x3 keyboard instead of a 1x3 row.
It's meant to supplement my normal shitty keyboard which lacks a volume knob, something that I sorely miss.
Btw the git commit history is so empty because I had some large .blend files in my last repo that I just couldn't get rid of (so GitHub didn't let me push) :P
